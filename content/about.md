:wave: I'm Visesh. \
:computer: I'm a software engineer working primarily with Python and occasionally some JavaScript. \
:massage_man: When I'm not at work, I like to tinker with my Raspberry Pis, work on my home lab, volunteer for non-profits (Red Cross, PSF) or watch movies with my wife. \
:airplane: I hate travelling, but I will travel if it is a conference about Python/Django. \
:sushi: I love trying new cuisines, although I would give up anything for a plate of sushi. \
:email: I'm always interested in hearing about new opportunities, so feel free to [email me](mailto:viseshrprasad@gmail.com) if you like my background.
