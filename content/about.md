👋 I'm Visesh. \
💻 I'm a software engineer working primarily with Python and JavaScript but I'm also passionate about DevOps and automation. \
🛠️ I work extensively with web architectures and cloud infrastructures as well as Python libraries and CI/CD pipelines that support them. \
🎓 I have a master's degree in Computer Science. \
📜 I'm a [Microsoft Certified](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viseshprasad/details/certifications/) Azure Developer Associate. \
💆‍♂️ When I'm not at work, I like to write [useful tools with Python](https://github.com/viseshrp?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=python&sort=),
tinker with [home automation](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and my [home lab](https://github.com/viseshrp/homelab)
running on Raspberry Pis, do home improvement, [volunteer for non-profits](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viseshprasad/details/volunteering-experiences/) or watch movies with my wife. \
🇪🇸 I'm currently learning Spanish. \
✈️ I'm not a fan of traveling, but I will if it is a conference about Python/Django. \
🍣 I love trying new cuisines, although I would give up anything for a plate of sushi. \
📧 I'm always interested in hearing about new opportunities, so feel free to [email me](mailto:viseshrprasad@gmail.com) if you like my [background](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6KvjIoOCo4denFodnh2akItZFU/view?usp=sharing).
