Newsletters are how I make sure I am not living under a rock.
This is just a brain dump of the newsletters I subscribe to and read regularly. If I ever lose access to my email, this is where I will come to find them.
Full disclosure: I am a full-stack developer technically, but I am more inclined towards backend development and system design.

### ðŸš€ Must-Reads (Cannot Live Without)

- **Hacker Newsletter** â€“ Hacker News' top posts, delivered weekly. Essentially developer heaven. Absolutely cannot live without.
- **Tech / Daily** â€“ Daily updates from Hacker News, if you are of the impatient kind.
- **TechCrunch Daily** â€“ Covers startups, Silicon Valley news, and tech industry trends. Highly recommended.
- **TLDR Dan** â€“ Quick, digestible summaries of tech news. Well-written TLDRs and not AI-generated crap (I hope).
- **Robinhood Snacks** â€“ Financial and stock market news with some well-thought humor.
- **Python Weekly** â€“ A must-have for Python developers with the latest libraries, tools, and articles.
- **SRE Weekly** â€“ Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) insights, best practices, system design and incident management.
- **JavaScript Weekly** â€“ The JavaScript version of Python Weekly, if you are into frontend development.

### ðŸ¤“ Nice to Have (Can Live Without, But Good to Know)

- **Pycoder's Weekly** â€“ Another solid Python newsletter, but not as essential as Python Weekly. Self-promotion and ads kill it sometimes.
- **Postgres Weekly** â€“ Postgres essential.
- **Tyler from ui.dev** â€“ Frontend development updates with humor.
- **BeansAndBytes** â€“ Recently discovered - like TLDR Dan but even more succinct.
- **Programmer Weekly** â€“ General programming news, tutorials, and discussions.
- **Frontend Focus** â€“ Web development and frontend technologies roundup.
- **Medium Weekly Digest** â€“ A collection of trending Medium posts, but can be hit-or-miss. Mostly behind paywall.
- **Lifehacker Newsletter** â€“ Productivity, life hacks, and tech tips. Hit-or-miss.
